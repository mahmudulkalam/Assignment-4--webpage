<p> For assignment 3, I decided to use hashmaps as my data structure to calculate the word frequencies. I went with hashmaps because the objective of this assignment was to retrieve word counts and the main use of hashmaps are for retrieving data based on a  key. If I had more time to work on this project, I would have added more effects and animations to my text. I wanted to add a blinking effect to my title, as well as center my image, but couldn't figure it out. When thinking of a song for assignment 3, the line, "somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me", was the the first thing that popped in my head, so I just went All Star by Smash Mouth. In 1999 the song peaked at #4 on the billboard Hot 100, so the song was definitely well-known. The top words in the song were the, on, go and to. This was not a surprise since they were mostly articles and conjunctions.
