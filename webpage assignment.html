Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire. How about yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars
Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep, what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey, now, you're an all star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold:</font>

<p> For assignment 3, I decided to use hashmaps as my data structure to calculate the word frequencies. I went with hashmaps because the objective of this assignment was to retrieve word counts and the main use of hashmaps are for retrieving data based on a  key. If I had more time to work on this project, I would have added more effects and animations to my text. I wanted to add a blinking effect to my title, as well as create some sort of shape out of the lyrics. I also wanted to center the image I included, but couldn't get it to work. When thinking of a song for assignment 3, the line, "somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me", was the the first thing that popped in my head, so I just went All Star by Smash Mouth. In 1999 the song peaked at #4 on the billboard Hot 100, so the song was definitely well-known. The top words in the song were the, on, go and to. This was not a surprise since they were mostly articles and conjunctions.
